## üöÄ Summary

SocialEcomApp is a social e-commerce iOS application built with SwiftUI using the **MVVM-C (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel‚ÄìCoordinator) architecture**. This project serves as a practical demonstration of modular design, coordinator-based navigation, and Firebase's real-time capabilities.

## Key Features

- Product Browsing: List view with filtering, search, and pagination
- Shopping Cart: Add/remove products with real-time count updates
- Product Details: Rich detail view with sharing capabilities
- Social Features: Comments system and live chat functionality
- Backend Flexibility: ServiceFactory pattern supporting Firestore and REST

## My thoughts and assumptions 
 - App will reach billions of users - Need to be scalable and maintainable. - In scope
 - Pagination for ProductList - In scope
 - Pagination for chat and comments, and cleanup: Chat and comments need pagination + retention policy to avoid memory bloat. - not in scope
 - Image caching: Catalog performance depends on optimized image loading and caching. - In scope 
 - Offline-first core flows: Browsing and cart must work without network; sync later.- In scope
 - User auth evolution: Start with anonymous users, but plan migration to social logins and Apple Sign-In. - In Scope
 - Rest API can be integrated. 

## ‚úÖ MVP and üö´ Out of MVP

### ‚úÖ In Scope (MVP)
- **Architecture:** MVVM-C + DataSource pattern, ServiceFactory for backend flexibility.  
- **Realtime:** Firestore listeners for chat & comments, optimistic UI updates.  
- **Memory & Errors:** ViewModel cleanup, basic error handling & retry.  
- **UX:** Anonymous users, threaded comments (1-level), per-product chat rooms.  
- **Cart:** Offline-first support via local DataSource.  
- **Performance:** Efficient product queries, AsyncImage with loading states, reactive UI with Combine.  

### üö´ Out of Scope (Future Versions)
- **Scale/Ops:** Chat retention policies, Firestore cost optimization, performance monitoring.  
- **Moderation:** Spam prevention, reporting & blocking, API rate limiting.  
- **Recommendations:** AI/ML-driven suggestions, trending/seasonal highlights.  
- **Advanced Chat:** Reactions, typing indicators, multimedia messages, chat profiles, push notifications.  
- **User Features:** Auth & profiles, social logins (e.g., Apple Sign-In, Facebook).  
- **Tech Enhancements:** Accessibility compliance and advanced caching strategies.

## üöÄ Challenges & Solutions

1. **Real-time Data Sync (Chat & Comments)**  
   - *Challenge:* Keeping UI consistent with Firestore listeners across multiple screens.  
   - *Solution:* Used `@Published` in ViewModels + Combine pipelines to auto-propagate updates.  

2. **Complex Navigation (Product ‚Üí Detail ‚Üí Chat/Comments/Cart)**  
   - *Challenge:* Avoiding view-driven navigation logic.  
   - *Solution:* Adopted **Coordinator pattern (MVVM-C)** to centralize flows and keep Views lightweight.  

3. **Testability with Firebase Dependencies**  
   - *Challenge:* Direct Firestore calls made unit testing difficult.  
   - *Solution:* Introduced **protocol-backed Services + ServiceFactory** to inject mocks for testing.  

4. **SwiftUI Limitation**  
   - *Challenge:* SwiftUI doesn‚Äôt provide a native ShareSheet.  
   - *Solution:* Implemented **UIViewControllerRepresentable** to integrate UIKit ShareSheet with SwiftUI.

## Architecture Overview
App follows a Coordinator Pattern with MVVM architecture, which is excellent for maintainability and testability:

 - AppCoordinator ‚Üí TabBarCoordinator ‚Üí Individual feature coordinators
 - Clear separation of concerns with ViewModels, DataSources, and Services
 - Protocol-oriented design for services (Firebase/REST flexibility)

## üõ† Tech Stack

*   **Language:** Swift 5.9+
*   **Frameworks:** SwiftUI, Combine.
*   **Architecture:** MVVM-C (Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel‚ÄìCoordinator).
*   **Backend:** Firebase Firestore (for the real-time database).
*   **Testing:** XCTest with mockable services facilitated by `ServiceFactory`.
*   **CI/CD:** Xcode build system (extendable with Fastlane/Jenkins).

## üß© Design Decisions

*   **MVVM-C** was chosen for its clear separation of concerns, providing a maintainable and testable codebase.
    *   **Views:** Handle the SwiftUI UI layer.
    *   **ViewModels:** Manage UI state and business logic.
    *   **DataSources:** Handle feature-specific data operations (e.g., pagination, caching).
    *   **Services:** Manage Firebase integrations behind protocol abstractions for testability.
    *   **Coordinators:** Orchestrate navigation flows throughout the app.
*   The **`ServiceFactory`** approach allows for easy swapping of real services with mock implementations during testing.
*   **Firestore listeners** are used to enable real-time updates for the chat and comments features.
*   **Protocol-oriented design** promotes dependency injection and simplifies the process of creating mocks.
